# Questionnaire

## Project 

Questionnaire is a simulation/puzzle type game, base on "Indefinite: 
Interrogation Game" by Brandon Li. 

## Motivation

The reason behing this game, was the project "Learning Projects" of the NCGM (Núcleo de Computação Gráfica e Multimédia), a student organization at FEUP. I love challeging myself so I didn't resist the opportunity of creating something fun in just two weeks.
